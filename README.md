Scope for Junit Testing:
The testing for the deployed BPM was scoped around tracking the flow of the process through the two gateways through random boolean assignments to the gateways and using System.out.printLn to inform where the process has ended, along with printing usful information like what the boolean values were for the gateways. 
First testing that the first gateway can successfully reach the next user task from either direction through the gateway.
Secondly testing if the second gateway can come to the same outcome as the first gateway.

Proof of Deployment:
Proof of BPM deployment can be found in the portfolio as an PNG called "deploymentProof.PNG"
